You can use Webrix as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrix), or as a script tag.

## As an NPM Package

You can install Webrix with `npm` (or `yarn` if you prefer).

```bash
# With npm
npm i webrix

# With yarn
yarn add webrix
```

Webrix requires has peer dependencies for `react`, `react-dom` and `prop-types`, so be sure to install them as well:

```bash
npm i react react-dom prop-types
```

You can then import components/hooks like so:

```jsx
import {Movable} from 'webrix/components';

// For better tree shaking you can make your imports more specific.
// This can potentially reduce your final bundle size, but the
// difference can be negligible since the entire Webrix library
// is rather small
import Movable from 'webrix/components/Movable';
```

## As a Script Tag

Alternatively you can add a `<script/>` tag to your document's `<head/>` and get Webrix through a CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/webrix@latest/webrix.umd.min.js" crossorigin></script>
```

Webrix does not work without `react`, `react-dom`, `prop-types` and `classnames`, so be sure to include those as well:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types/prop-types.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/classnames" crossorigin></script>
```

You can now access everything through the global `Webrix` variable:

```js
const {Movable} = Webrix.components;
```
