import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

## Features

* `Scrollable` - Changed scrollbars architecture, removed instance access, converted scrollbars to functional components and improved overall performance.
* `Scrollable` - Added `Scrollable.Context` through which the `container` ref is available.
* `Scrollable` - Added CSS API. See <Link to='/docs/components/scrollable#api-css-custom-properties'>Scrollable CSS API</Link>.

## Bug Fixes

* `Scrollable` - Migrated to CSS-based scrollbar calculations. This provides a more performant and robust way of updating the scrollbars.

## Breaking Changes

* `Scrollable` - Consuming the `container` through context rather than props in `Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar` and `Scrollable.VerticalScrollbar`.
                 If you have custom scrollbars, you no longer need to provide `ref` access via `forwardRef`, and the `container` will no longer be provider through the props.
