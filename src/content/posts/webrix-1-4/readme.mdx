## Features

* `Scrollable` - Added a new prop: `onUpdate`
* `Scrollable` - Changed the `onScroll` prop to only trigger when the user scrolls, as opposed to calling it on every scrollbar update as it did until now.
                 This is done in order to better match the native `onScroll` event.

## Bug Fixes

* `Scrollable` - Reduced reflow/repaint
* `Collapsible` - Fixed ``--expanded` variable inheritance messing with the `onTransitionEnd` listener
