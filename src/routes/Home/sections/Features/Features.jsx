                        <p>Webrix is not a component bank, but rather a set of low-level components (bricks) with which you can
                            create your own component bank.</p>
                    </Feature>
                    <Feature title='Single Responsibility' icon={<span>1</span>}>
                        <p>As opposed to other UI component banks, where each component comes packed with features that you don't need,
                            in Webrix each component (brick) has a single, dedicated responsibility.</p>
                    </Feature>
                    <Feature title='Unbranded' icon={<FaCopyright/>}>
                        <p>Each brick has little to no CSS, so you won't have to override anything
                            to make it look the way you want to.</p>
                    </Feature>

                        <p>Webrix is already used in one of Amdocs' largest products, and has been for the past few years.
                            We've faced many challenges, and created different bricks to solve them.</p>
                    </Feature>
                    <Feature title='Small Footprint' icon={<FaShoePrints/>}>
                        <p>The minified version of the library is only around ~{LIBRARY_SIZE/*global LIBRARY_SIZE*/}kb. However, Webrix' is structured
                            in a way that supports tree-shaking, allowing you to only bundle what you're using.</p>
